To turn on the system, first turn the key to the right of "POWER FREE" to ON, then turn on the box below (labeled AMX) and make sure that it shows "3" as the leftmost number. This means that it's using the HDMI cabel located in the middle of the table. `UNTIL THE FRONT-TABLE HDMI CABLE IS FIXED, DO NOT USE IT ALONG WITH INPUT SIGNAL 1`. Once the system is turned on, `wait for five minutes`, then plug HDMI cable to computer and turn on the TV.
