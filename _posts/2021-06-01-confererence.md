To turn on the system, first turn the key to the right of "POWER FREE" to ON, then turn on the box labeled AMX (Below the Polycom box). If "3" is shown as the leftmost number on the AMX box as shown below, it means that the TV video input signal comes from the HDMI cabel (to be connected to a computer) located at the `middle` of the table. If "1" is shown, it means that the TV will be in remote video conferencing mode (_`This value is changed by first pressing the right/left arrow button to control the position to be changed then press the up/down arrow button to change the number, and finally the check button to confirm`_). Check the chart at the bottom of the page for HDMI cable-input signal correspondence. `UNTIL THE FRONT-TABLE HDMI CABLE IS FIXED, DO NOT USE IT ALONG WITH AMX BOX INPUT SIGNAL 4`. Once the system is turned on, `wait for five minutes`, then turn on the TV.
