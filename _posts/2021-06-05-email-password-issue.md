If your email suddenly malfunctions and can't be logged in. See if the screen has `your_email@ecidi.com` shown anywhere. Because of the `hdec` -> `ecidi` change, the email software might still be caching the old address. If it does show `your_email@ecidi.com` anywhere even though you are loggin in using `your_email@hdec.com`, try correcting it. If no avail, reinstall the email software and log in again.

The point person for all email issues is listed in the Contact Us page.
